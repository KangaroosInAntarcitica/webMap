# Web Map

This project can be used to generate HTML files with a map, displaying information about films filmed in a specified year.   
**Before using, you need to install folium to python (`pip install folium`)**

### Features:
1. Display films and locations, where they were filmed by coordinates.   
   (User can see what films were created in a certain location on map)

2. Display **population** in a country (information taken from world.json)

3. Display **number of films**, that were filmed in a country (world.json is required)

   User can also visualy evaluate the **number of films filmed in a county by a unit of population**.   
   (if they simultaneously displays both the population and film amount information)   
   (*Hue* represents the amount / population, while *saturation and lightness* of that color shows the 2 numbers compared to other countries)

   The main program is located in [map_locations.py](https://github.com/KangaroosInAntarcitica/webMap/blob/master/map_locations.py) file.   
   Program asks user to specify the `year` and generates `html` to the corresponding year   
   Program can get the geocode inforamtion from a `file` (like `geocodes.list` or by sending requests to **ArcGIS** - when no file is specified)   

   The `geocodes.list` contains information about coordinates of most locations, where films from the `locations.list` were filmed.   
   It was generated by sending requests with [app.js](https://github.com/KangaroosInAntarcitica/webMap/blob/master/app.js) in this project.
